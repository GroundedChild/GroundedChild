I am an 18-year-old who is currently trying to improve my skills in software engineering and Roblox game creation. As of right now, I am putting most of my effort into learning Lua for Roblox scripting. I prefer to work independently unless I am too stuck to complete a project by myself. I do not share my contact information or collaborate with others unless I really trust them. All the projects listed on my account are personal experiments, and they do not reflect any professional or commercial goals.
